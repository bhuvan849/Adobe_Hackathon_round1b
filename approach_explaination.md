# Document Analysis System - Approach Explanation

## Overview

This document analysis system employs a multi-layered, persona-driven approach to intelligently extract and rank the most relevant document sections based on user context and specific tasks. The system combines advanced natural language processing, structural document analysis, and domain-specific constraints to deliver highly targeted results.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Multi-Strategy Document Parsing

The system uses a three-tier fallback strategy for document parsing:

- **Primary**: Bookmark/TOC extraction for structured documents
- **Secondary**: Advanced visual analysis using font characteristics, formatting patterns, and layout detection
- **Tertiary**: Content-based extraction using pattern recognition and paragraph segmentation

This approach ensures robust section extraction across diverse document types, from formal reports to unstructured PDFs.

### 2. Persona-Driven Analysis Engine

The analysis engine adapts its scoring methodology based on the user's persona (researcher, analyst, contractor, etc.) and specific job requirements. Key features include:

- **Domain-Specific Keywords**: Each persona has associated terminology that receives prioritized scoring
- **Task-Specific Patterns**: Different job types (review, analysis, planning) trigger relevant content boosting
- **Constraint-Based Filtering**: Hard filters exclude unwanted content (e.g., non-vegetarian items for vegetarian meal planning), while soft boosts prioritize preferred content

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Scoring System

Section relevance is calculated using five weighted scoring dimensions:

1. **Semantic Similarity (40%)**: Uses sentence transformers to compute cosine similarity between enhanced queries and section content
2. **Persona Relevance (20%)**: Matches content against persona-specific keywords and terminology
3. **Task Alignment (20%)**: Evaluates content relevance to the specific job-to-be-done
4. **Constraint Boosts (10%)**: Applies domain-specific multipliers based on constraint patterns
5. **Quality Metrics (10%)**: Considers content length, structure, and extraction confidence

### 4. Intelligent Content Enhancement

The system creates enhanced queries by combining the original persona and task with contextually relevant keywords. This approach improves semantic matching accuracy and ensures the ranking algorithm understands the nuanced requirements of different user types.

### 5. Diversity and Quality Assurance

To prevent redundant results, the system applies:

- **Diversity Filtering**: Uses embedding similarity to avoid selecting overly similar sections
- **Quality Validation**: Filters out noise, page numbers, and irrelevant content
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Extracts key sentences using multiple criteria including semantic relevance, position importance, and keyword density

## Technical Implementation

The system leverages PyMuPDF for document processing, sentence-transformers for semantic analysis, and custom pattern matching for constraint application. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization of domain-specific rules.

## Adaptive Features

The constraint system dynamically adapts to different use cases. For example, when processing vegetarian menu requests, it automatically excludes meat-based items while boosting plant-based alternatives. This context-aware filtering ensures results are not just semantically similar but practically useful for the specific user and task.

This comprehensive approach balances computational efficiency with result quality, delivering highly relevant document sections tailored to each user's unique requirements and professional context.
